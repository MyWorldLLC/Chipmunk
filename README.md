# Chipmunk
Chipmunk is a dynamically typed scripting language designed for embedding in JVM applications.

Please note that the language, interpreter, & APIs are in an alpha state and are subject to change. Do not attempt
to use this in your own projects if you are not prepared to deal with the instability of an actively developed pre-release
project.
